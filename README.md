# Goal
-In this assignment I was tasked with creating a from scratch website using bootstrap elements that are dynamic and respond to the changing size of the page.
-I needed links that worked in a navbar and different elements talking about things I do, a page where they can contact me and a page where they can see a few of things I've done.

# Execution
-I created my home page simply to state a few things about myself, I made the navbar the same on all pages and the title part links to the home page
-The portfolio page has a few photos I've taken on my hobby trips and I put them in a grid exactly like the other two, they're both responsive images and responsive grids
-The contact page has a form element, the rubric didn't say that the form needed to actually submit to a log or a DB, so it is functionaly useless, however it is responsive and looks pretty decent.

# Conclusion
-I had fun with this, if I spent more time in this then I could've made it look very cool, however in a gain/time spent argument, I need to sleep and focus on other work.
